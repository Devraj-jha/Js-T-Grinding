js => flexible quick but can make mistake

typescipt => drawing with ruler and guides

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript 
that adds static typing and extra features, 
then compiles (transpiles) down to regular
 JavaScript so browsers can run it

 js = buggy
 dyanamic, loosely typed

 | Problem in JavaScript                                                                       | How TypeScript Helps                                                      |

| You can pass a string to a function expecting a number, and JS wonâ€™t warn until it crashes. | TS checks **types at compile time** and warns instantly.                  |
| Large codebases are hard to maintain.                                                       | TS makes code **self-documenting** with type annotations.                 |
| Refactoring risks breaking hidden parts of the code.                                        | TS provides **intellisense**, autocompletion, and safe refactoring tools. |
| New developers struggle to understand object shapes.                                        | TS defines **interfaces** & **type definitions**.                         |
